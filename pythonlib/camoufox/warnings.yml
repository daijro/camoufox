navigator: >-
    Manually setting navigator properties is not recommended.
    Device information is automatically generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided `os`.

locale: >-
    Use the `locale` parameter in Camoufox instead of setting the config manually.

geolocation: >-
    Please use the `geoip` parameter in Camoufox instead of setting your geolocation manually.
    This can lead to detection if your target geolocation does not match your IP.
    Pass `geoip=True` or a target IP (ex: geoip='123.45.67.89') to let Camoufox populate this data for you.

header-ua: >-
    Do not set the header.User-Agent manually. Camoufox will generate a User-Agent for you.

viewport: >-
    Manually setting screen & window properties is not recommended.
    Screen dimensions are randomly generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided screen constraints. See here:
    https://github.com/daijro/camoufox/tree/main/pythonlib#browserforge-integration.

custom_fingerprint: >-
    Passing your own fingerprint is not recommended.
    BrowserForge fingerprints are automatically generated within Camoufox
    based on the provided `os` and `screen` constraints.

proxy_without_geoip: >-
    When using a proxy, it is heavily recommended that you pass `geoip=True`.

allow_webgl: >-
    Enabling WebGL can lead to Canvas fingerprinting and detection.
    Camoufox will automatically spoof your vendor and renderer, but it cannot spoof your WebGL fingerprint.

ff_version: >-
    Spoofing the Firefox version will likely lead to detection.
    If rotating the Firefox version is absolutely necessary, it would be more advisable to
    rotate between older versions of Camoufox instead.

no_region: >-
    Because you did not pass in a locale region, Camoufox will generate one for you.
    This can cause suspicion if your IP does not match your locale region.
